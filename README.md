# LLVM - Bytecode to DOT

A LLVM pass that prints bytecode programs into the dot format.

This is a [DCC888 class](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~fernando/classes/dcc888/) project assignment.

# Description

You must write your own pass, and it must have a few requirements:

- Each instruction must be printed with an opcode;
- All the arguments of an instruction must be printed next to this instruction;
- Arguments that do not have names, such as getelementptr in function calls, should not be printed;
- Type information should not be printed.
